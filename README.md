Senior_Project
==============

Senior Project for Computer Inofrmation Systems Degree at University of Houston - Clear Lake.

This project is designed for the medical industry.

We have created a way for users to scan medical records at scanning stations (client machines), those files to automatically be transferred to a server where they are transformed to .pdf and put into a file hold.  We then have a web interface for users to search, view, and update document database records.

Features:
1. Barcode generation and reading
2. FTP uploading
3. Quality Control for unreadable documents.
4. Document search by patients.
5. Conversion of images to .pdf

Our design of this project focuses on ease of use, flexibility, and maintainability.
